# German Nine Men's Morris

This game is similar to the original Nine Men's Morris. The board, as well as some rules, are different from the original version. This is an end-to-end project, from customer requirements doc to Software Engineering diagrams  and finally to the code itself. All of which can be found in this repository. To open the diagrams, one must have the Visual Paradigm tool installed. This project was developed by me and my two friends, João Victor Volpato and João Paulo Bonomo, over the span of 18 weeks. The game is built in Python and can be played online.
